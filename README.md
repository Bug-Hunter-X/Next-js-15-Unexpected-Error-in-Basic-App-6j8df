# Next.js 15 Unexpected Error in Basic App

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Next.js 15 that can occur even in a simple application. The error is often caused by issues with the project structure or incorrect JSX syntax. The error messages provided by Next.js might not be very descriptive, making it challenging to diagnose.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file shows a minimal Next.js application. However, subtle issues with directory structure or JSX may lead to unexpected errors during runtime.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code and details of potential solutions.

**To reproduce the bug:** Introduce a small error into `bug.js` such as a missing closing tag in the JSX or placing the file in an incorrect location within the `pages` directory.

## Potential Solutions

1. **Double-check JSX syntax:**  Ensure all JSX elements have matching opening and closing tags, and that there are no syntax errors.
2. **Verify directory structure:** Make sure the `pages` directory is structured correctly. Any deviations from the standard Next.js file structure can cause problems.
3. **Check your Next.js version:** Ensure you are using a compatible version of Next.js and its dependencies.
4. **Clean your project:** In some cases, running `npm run clean` or a similar command to remove the `.next` folder can resolve the issue.
