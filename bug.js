```javascript
// pages/index.js

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my Next.js app</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
This simple Next.js app might unexpectedly throw an error if the `pages` directory isn't structured correctly or if there's a problem with the JSX syntax.  It's an uncommon error because it's so basic, but it highlights the importance of a clean project structure and accurate JSX.
